Jeffrey Epstein was accused of operating a massive and systematic sex trafficking ring that exploited underage girls for over two decades. He allegedly lured girls—some as young as 14—into his orbit under the pretense of paying them for massages,
which would escalate into sexual abuse. These encounters occurred regularly at his properties in Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York; his ranch in New Mexico; and especially on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, often referred to as 
"Pedophile Island." After abusing the girls, Epstein would pay them and then encourage or pressure them to bring in more underage girls, creating a pyramid scheme of sexual exploitation.The abuse was described by victims as routine, repeated, and manipulative. 
Epstein allegedly groomed vulnerable girls, many from troubled or financially desperate backgrounds, and built a network of enablers who helped recruit and transport them. In many cases, the girls were flown on Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express,” 
to various locations, where they were assaulted. Some victims said they were raped. Others described being trafficked to powerful men Epstein was connected to—politicians, businessmen, royals—though many of those named have denied wrongdoing and not all were confirmed
or charged.
Epstein was arrested in 2019 by federal authorities and charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors. Epstein’s arrest in 2019 reopened the floodgates of victim testimony and public scrutiny. He was denied bail and found dead in his jail cell 
at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York a month later. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging, but suspicious circumstances—malfunctioning cameras, sleeping guards, and a removed cellmate—fueled widespread belief that he was murdered to protect others
involved. The phrase “Epstein didn’t kill himself” became a viral meme and cultural shorthand for elite impunity.
